# finpilot Example Scripts

## When to Use

- You need to add a third-party repository or desktop swap
- You want to understand the `.example` → `.sh` activation pattern
- You are creating a new build script and want a starting point
- You need to document a new pattern for contributors

## When NOT to Use

- You are modifying existing active `.sh` scripts directly — edit them, don't activate an example
- You are adding a simple package — use `build/10-build.sh` directly, no example needed

## Core Process

1. **Find the relevant example** in `build/` directory
2. **Copy and rename** from `.example` to `.sh`
3. **Customize** for your specific use case
4. **Validate** with `shellcheck` and `just build`
5. **Commit** (via PR to `main`)

## The Activation Pattern

All example scripts in `build/` follow the pattern:

1. **Inactive**: Named `NN-descriptive-name.sh.example`
2. **Active**: Rename to `NN-descriptive-name.sh`
3. **Execution**: Build scripts run in numerical order (`00-`, `10-`, `20-`, `30-`)

**Important:** Only `.sh` files are executed during the build. `.example` files are ignored.

## Existing Example Scripts

### `build/20-onepassword.sh.example`

**What it does:**

- Adds the 1Password repository
- Installs `1password` and `1password-cli`
- Removes the repo file after install (isolated install pattern)

**How to activate:**

```bash
cp build/20-onepassword.sh.example build/20-onepassword.sh
# Edit build/20-onepassword.sh to customize if needed
```

**Expected validation:**

- `pr-validation.yml` → shellcheck
- `build-image.yml` → full build test

---

### `build/30-cosmic-desktop.sh.example`

**What it does:**

- Removes the GNOME desktop environment
- Installs the COSMIC desktop environment from COPR
- Sets the default graphical target

**How to activate:**

```bash
cp build/30-cosmic-desktop.sh.example build/30-cosmic-desktop.sh
# Edit build/30-cosmic-desktop.sh to customize if needed
```

**Expected validation:**

- `pr-validation.yml` → shellcheck
- `build-image.yml` → full build test (significant change, test thoroughly)

---

## Creating New Example Scripts

When adding a new pattern that others might reuse, create an `.example` file:

1. **Name it** with the correct prefix: `20-` for third-party repos, `30-` for desktop swaps
2. **Include comments** explaining what it does and how to customize
3. **Follow conventions**: `set -euo pipefail`, `dnf5`, `copr_install_isolated` for COPRs
4. **Add to this skill** (or `AGENTS.md`) so agents know it exists

### Template for New Examples

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Description: [What this script does]
# Activate by: cp build/NN-name.sh.example build/NN-name.sh
# Customize: [What to change]

# Example: Add a third-party repository
# dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://example.com/repo.repo
# dnf5 install -y package-name
# rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/example.repo  # Clean up repo file
```

## Validation by Example Type

| Example                      | Shellcheck | Build Test | Additional Validation                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Third-party repo (`20-*.sh`) | Yes        | Yes        | Verify repo URL accessible              |
| Desktop swap (`30-*.sh`)     | Yes        | Yes        | Test in VM (`just run-vm-qcow2`)        |
| COPR install (`20-*.sh`)     | Yes        | Yes        | Verify COPR exists and packages install |

## Link to Package Decision Tree

For deciding whether to use an example script or add directly to `build/10-build.sh`, see `finpilot-packages.md`.

**Quick guide:**

- Simple system packages → `build/10-build.sh`
- Third-party repo or complex install → `build/20-*.sh` (activate an example or create new)
- Desktop environment swap → `build/30-*.sh` (activate an example or create new)

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                                              | Reality                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'll just add my script directly — no need for an example." | If the pattern is reusable, an example helps future contributors. If it's one-off, add to `10-build.sh`. |
| "I'll leave it as `.example` and never rename it."           | `.example` files are ignored in the build. They must be renamed to `.sh` to have any effect.             |
| "I modified the `.example` file — that should be enough."    | The build only runs `.sh` files. Modify the `.example`, then rename to `.sh`.                            |

## Red Flags

- `.example` file modified but not renamed to `.sh`
- New `.sh` file without `set -euo pipefail`
- Script using `dnf` or `yum` instead of `dnf5`
- COPR repo not disabled after install
- Third-party repo file not removed after install
- Missing shellcheck validation before committing

## Verification

- [ ] Did you rename the `.example` file to `.sh`?
- [ ] Did you run `shellcheck` on the new `.sh` file?
- [ ] Did the build succeed with `just build`?
- [ ] For desktop swaps: did you test in a VM (`just run-vm-qcow2`)?
- [ ] For desktop swaps: did you verify the new session works at the login screen?
- [ ] Did you document the new pattern in `AGENTS.md` or this skill?
