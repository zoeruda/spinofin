## Tips

- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Don't end subject line with a period
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Use body to explain _what_ and _why_, not _how_
- Be short and concise, avoid long commit messages, keep it simple
- Reference issues/PRs in footer when applicable
